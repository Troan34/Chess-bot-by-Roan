Chess bot, OpenGL (minimum 4.0) based on TheCherno's series.
This is basically my first "actual project", even tho i don't know c++ in depth, i hope i will be able to learn from this multi-month project.
I WILL receive criticism as long as it's constructive.
And yeah that's all, i will maybe add an explanation on how the project is structured.
